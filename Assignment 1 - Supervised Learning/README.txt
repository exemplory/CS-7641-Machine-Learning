Steps to run my code:
1. All the code and data is available at a public Github repository hosted at: https://github.com/exemplory/CS-7641-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Assignment%201%20-%20Supervised%20Learning
2. Download the data files: adult.csv and phishing.csv
3. The entire code is in Python 3 and requires the latest version of sciti-leark (v.0.21.3), Numpy and Pandas (any version will work)
3. The easiest way to run the code is to download the Jupyter Notebooks and run on Python 3. 
	- Assignment1-DataSet1.ipynb (for problem 1)
	- Assignment1-DataSet2.ipynb (for problem 2)
4. The other option to run the code and generate the charts is to download the python files and run from the command line (Note the charts are generated as an output on the console and are not saved to image files)
	- Assignment1-DataSet1.py
	- Assignment1-DataSet2.py
5. If you dont want to run the code, but just want to see the output, then you can open the HTML files to see the output from the last run (which was used to write the report)
	- Assignment1-DataSet1.html
	- Assignment1-DataSet2.html
